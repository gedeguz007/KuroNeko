    <h1>Two Sisters</h1>

    <h2>My sister and me</h2>

    <p>
      <img src="images/percyartkittens.JPG" alt="kittens playing" class="floatleft" />
      Hi, my name is Persephone but you can call me Percy. My dad is Gabe and he's been my daddy since 2010.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/percyartbestfriends.jpg" alt="cat shelf" class="floatright" />
      He adopted me and my sister, Artemis, when we were just babies.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      <img src="images/peryartsuitcase.JPG" alt="cats suitcase" class="floatleft" />
      Artemis and I played a lot and we would get into lots of trouble. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/percyartstack.jpg" alt="cat stack" class="floatright" />
      Artemis and I used to wrestle, run up and down the stairs, and climb up curtains.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="topshelfcats.JPG" alt="topshelf" class="floatleft" />
      Our favorite was to climb to the tops of shelves. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/lonelypercy.jpeg" alt="lonely cat" class="floatright" />
      After a few years of fun and laughter, Artemis got sick and my daddy took her to the hospital. 
    </p>
    
    <p>  
      But Artemis never came back home. I was pretty sad for a long time and I missed my 
      sister because she was my best friend.
   </p>
    
    <h2>A New Arrival</h2>

    <p>
      <img src="images/babyfreyaarrival.jpeg" alt="Baby Freya" class="floatleft" />
      After about a year and a half, my daddy came home with another baby. Her name is Freya and she's a lot of trouble. 
    </p> 
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/babyfreyablep.jpeg" alt="Baby Freya Blep" class="floatright" />
      I didn't know what to think of her at first. She looked like Artemis when she was a baby. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/freyablep.jpg" alt="Freya Blep" class="floatleft" />
      Freya was really shy for a few days and my daddy played with her a lot. She wanted to play with me but I thought that she was too much. I'm tired just
      watching her run, jump, and play. She would try to tackle me and it got old real quick.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/freyayawn.jpeg" alt="Freya Yawn" class="floatright" />
      I must admit that Freya is really cute, but I'm cuter and I'm dad's favorite.
    </p>

    <p>
      I guess I've gotten used to Freya since we are alone when my daddy is at work. 
      <img src="images/freyapercybestfriendstower.JPG" alt="Cats Tower"  class="floatleft" />
    </p>
      
    <p>
      <img src="images/freyapercybestfriendsnow.jpeg" alt="Freya Percy Bestfriends" class="floatright" />    
      We would play but I can't really keep up with her too much. I just want to hang out and relax. The best
      part though is when Freya and I just watch the birds, squirrels, and mice in the backyard from the inside. I also love hanging out on the couch and taking naps. I will never
      forget Artemis but I'm very happy to have a new best friend and sister in Freya.
