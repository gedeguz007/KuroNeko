    <h1>Two Sisters</h1>

    <h2>My sister and me</h2>

    <p>
      <img src="images/percyartkittens.JPG" alt="kittens playing" style="float:right" /> <br>
      Hi, my name is Persephone but you can call me Percy. <br>
      My dad is Gabe and he's been my daddy since 2010. <br>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/percyartbestfriends.jpg" alt="cat shelf" style="float:right" /> <br>
      He adopted me and my sister, Artemis, when we were just babies. <br>
    </p>
      
    <p>
      <img src="images/peryartsuitcase.JPG" alt="cats suitcase" style="float:left" /> <br>
      Artemis and I played a lot and we would get into lots of trouble. <br>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/percyartstack.jpg" alt="cat stack" style="float:right" /> <br>
      Artemis and I used to wrestle, run up and down the stairs, and climb up curtains. <br>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/topshelfcats.JPG" alt="topshelf" style="float:left" /> <br>
      Our favorite was to climb to the tops of shelves. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/lonelypercy.jpeg" alt="lonely cat" style="float:right" /> <br>
      After a few years of fun and laughter, Artemis got sick <br> 
      and my daddy took her to the hospital. <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>  
      But Artemis never came back home. <br>
      I was pretty sad for a long time and I missed my sister because she was my best friend. <br>
   </p>
    
    <h2>A New Arrival</h2>

    <p>
      <img src="images/babyfreyaarrival.jpeg" alt="Baby Freya" style="float:left" /> <br>
      After about a year and a half, my daddy came home with another baby. <br>
      Her name is Freya and she's a lot of trouble. <br>
    </p> 
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/babyfreyablep.jpeg" alt="Baby Freya Blep" style="float:right" /> <br>
      I didn't know what to think of her at first. <br>
      She looked like Artemis when she was a baby. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/freyablep.jpg" alt="Freya Blep" style="float:left" /> <br>
      Freya was really shy for a few days and my daddy played with her a lot. <br>
      She wanted to play with me but I thought that she was too much. <br>
      I'm tired just watching her run, jump, and play. <br>
      She would try to tackle me and it got old real quick. <br>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/freyayawn.jpeg" alt="Freya Yawn" style="float:right" /> <br>
      I must admit that Freya is really cute, <br>
      but I'm cuter and I'm dad's favorite. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/freyapercybestfriendstower.JPG" alt="Cats Tower"  style="float:left" /> <br>
      I guess I've gotten used to Freya since we are alone when my daddy is at work. <br>
     </p>
      
    <p>
      <img src="images/freyapercybestfriendsnow.jpeg" alt="Freya Percy Bestfriends" style="float:right" /> <br> 
      We would play but I can't really keep up with her too much. <br>
      I just want to hang out and relax. <br>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/freyapercycattv.jpeg" alt="cat tv" style="float:left" />
      The best part though is when Freya and I just watch the birds, squirrels, and mice in the backyard from the inside. <br>
      I also love hanging out on the couch and taking naps. <br>
      I will never forget Artemis but I'm very happy to have a new best friend and sister in Freya. <br>
  </p>
