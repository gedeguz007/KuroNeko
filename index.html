    <h1>Two Sisters</h1>

    <h2>My sister and me</h2>

    <p>
      <img src="images/percyartkittens.JPG" alt="kittens playing" style="float:right" />
      Hi, my name is Persephone but you can call me Percy.
      My dad is Gabe and he's been my daddy since 2010.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/percyartbestfriends.jpg" alt="cat shelf" style="float:right" />
      He adopted me and my sister, Artemis, when we were just babies.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      <img src="images/peryartsuitcase.JPG" alt="cats suitcase" style="float:left" />
      Artemis and I played a lot and we would get into lots of trouble.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/percyartstack.jpg" alt="cat stack" style="float:right" />
      Artemis and I used to wrestle, run up and down the stairs, and climb up curtains.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/topshelfcats.JPG" alt="topshelf" style="float:left" />
      Our favorite was to climb to the tops of shelves.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/lonelypercy.jpeg" alt="lonely cat" style="float:right" />
      After a few years of fun and laughter, Artemis got sick and my daddy took her to the hospital.
    </p>
    
    <p>  
      But Artemis never came back home.
      I was pretty sad for a long time and I missed my sister because she was my best friend.
   </p>
    
    <h2>A New Arrival</h2>

    <p>
      <img src="images/babyfreyaarrival.jpeg" alt="Baby Freya" style="float:left" />
      After about a year and a half, my daddy came home with another baby.
      Her name is Freya and she's a lot of trouble.
    </p> 
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/babyfreyablep.jpeg" alt="Baby Freya Blep" style="float:right" />
      I didn't know what to think of her at first.
      She looked like Artemis when she was a baby.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/freyablep.jpg" alt="Freya Blep" style="float:left" />
      Freya was really shy for a few days and my daddy played with her a lot.
      She wanted to play with me but I thought that she was too much.
      I'm tired just watching her run, jump, and play.
      She would try to tackle me and it got old real quick.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/freyayawn.jpeg" alt="Freya Yawn" style="float:right" />
      I must admit that Freya is really cute,but I'm cuter and I'm dad's favorite.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/freyapercybestfriendstower.JPG" alt="Cats Tower"  style="float:left" />
      I guess I've gotten used to Freya since we are alone when my daddy is at work. 
     </p>
      
    <p>
      <img src="images/freyapercybestfriendsnow.jpeg" alt="Freya Percy Bestfriends" style="float:right" /> <br> 
      We would play but I can't really keep up with her too much. <br>
      I just want to hang out and relax. <br>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <img src="images/freyapercycattv.jpeg" alt="cat tv" style="float:left" />
      The best part though is when Freya and I just watch the birds, squirrels, and mice in the backyard from the inside.
      I also love hanging out on the couch and taking naps.
      I will never forget Artemis but I'm very happy to have a new best friend and sister in Freya.
